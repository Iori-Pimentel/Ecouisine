        <h2>Our Budget Meal Planning Tips</h2>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>BREAKFASTS ARE THE PERFECT MEALS TO REPEAT</h3>
              <p>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but unfortunately a lot of people skip it. If you have just a few breakfasts that you habitually make and rotate through, you’re much more likely to enjoy a healthy breakfast. Select just 1 or 2 to make in bulk for the week and regardless of how chaotic your weekday mornings are, you know you’ll start the day fueled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>TURN YOUR DINNER INTO LEFTOVERS FOR LUNCH</h3>
              <p>Going out to lunch every day can be a bad habit for your health and bank account. If you’re gonna be cooking dinner, you might as well double and have some leftovers for lunch. Spend a little money on good lunch containers and a fun lunch bag to make your home cooked option something special. Plus, bringing your lunch saves you time from waiting in busy lunch lines. Use that extra time for a post-lunch walk with some coworkers!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>COOK MORE VEGETARIAN MEALS</h3>
              <p>Animal proteins are definitely more expensive than vegetarian proteins. Find a small handful of vegetarian recipes that utilize beans, lentils, tofu, and whole grains together that the whole family will enjoy, and you’re sure to see savings on your grocery bill. Plus, eating more vegetarian meals is just better for the environment since raising animals is very resource intensive.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>LET EACH RECIPE INFORM THE NEXT</h3>
              <p>Don’t just select a set of random recipes. Select one, look at the ingredient list and let that help you select recipe #2, and so on. For example, if recipe #1 uses half a head of cabbage, you might find another recipe that needed cabbage to prevent food waste. Or if you were going to make rice for recipe #1, try to find a recipe that used leftover rice for recipe #2, so you can make once and eat twice! If you need help finding recipes with specific ingredients, sites like Yummly or Foodily can be very helpful.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>STORE AND COOK INGREDIENTS BASED ON PERISHABILITY</h3>
              <p>When deciding on order, use up your more perishable items earlier in the week. It also helps to store them so that they’re more visible too. Refer to our Produce Care and Shelf-Life Guide on the next page to make sure you’re storing and using up your produce optimally.</p>
