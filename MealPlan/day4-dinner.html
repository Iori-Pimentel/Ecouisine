        <img src="../images/Food/food-13.png" alt="Tofu and Broccoli Stir-Fry with Quinoa">
        <p>Here’s another great budget vegetarian dinner. Tofu is another
          one of our budget ingredients - this vegetarian protein is
          a blank canvas for whatever seasoning you want to add.
          However, if you’re still not ready to embrace tofu, sub in your
          favorite budget cut of meat. However, when coated in this
          delicious sauce, we promise you might become a convert (and
          reduce your future grocery bills!).</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Garlic, minced - 4 cloves</li>
          <li>Broccoli, chopped - 2 lbs</li>
          <li>Extra-firm preferably vacuum-packed tofu, cubed - 20 oz</li>
          <li>Soy sauce - 3 Tbsp</li>
          <li>Rice vinegar - 2 Tbsp</li>
          <li>Sugar - 1/2 tsp</li>
          <li>Water - 1/2 cup</li>
          <li>Quinoa, uncooked - 2 cups</li>
          <li>Cornstarch - 2 Tbsp + 2 tsp</li>
          <li>Cooking oil - 2 Tbsp + 1 Tbsp</li>
          <li>Lemon, juice of - 1/2</li>
          <li>Hot sauce - to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prep</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Garlic / Broccoli | Prep as directed. (Can be done up to 3
            days ahead).</li>
          <li>Tofu | If not using vacuum-packed tofu, press liquid out of
            tofu.</li>
          <li>Make stir-fry sauce | Mix together garlic, soy sauce, rice
            vinegar, sugar, and water.</li>
          <li>Cook quinoa | If not already made earlier this week,
            combine quinoa with water in a saucepan using a 2:1 water
            to quinoa ratio. Salt, cover, and bring to a boil. Lower heat
            to a simmer and cook until quinoa absorbs all the water, 8
            to 10 minutes. Uncover and fluff with a fork.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Make</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Toss tofu with first part of cornstarch.</li>
          <li>Place broccoli in a microwave-safe pan. Cover with a
            damp paper towel and microwave for 1 1/2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Heat a wok or saute pan over medium-high heat. Add
            first part of oil and then tofu to the heated oil. Spread tofu
            out as evenly as possible and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes.
            Toss and saute for another 2 to 3 minutes. Add 3 Tbsp
            of the sauce into the wok and toss for another minute.
            Sprinkle generously with black pepper and remove
            from pan.</li>
          <li>Add second part of cornstarch to remainder of the sauce.</li>
          <li>Return pan back to medium-high heat. Add second part
            of oil and then broccoli with a sprinkle of salt. Toss for
            ~1 minute and then return tofu back to the pan. Push
            ingredients out to the side, forming a donut hole in the
            middle. Give the sauce a stir and pour sauce into the
            middle.</li>
          <li>Wait for it to bubble and darken before tossing
            everything through. Finish with lemon juice.
          </li>
          <li>Taste and season with more salt, pepper, soy sauce, or
            hot sauce as needed. Save half the stir-fry and quinoa for
            Saturday’s lunch and enjoy the rest tonight!</li>
