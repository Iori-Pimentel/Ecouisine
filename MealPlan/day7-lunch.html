        <p>Who doesn’t love spaghetti and meat sauce? This classic is
          comforting and also very budget friendly! Ground meat is
          cheaper when purchased in bulk, which is why we use across
          two meals. If you still have more leftover, you can also freeze
          the extra. We sneak in a good amount of veggies into our meat
          sauce to bulk it up without having to use as much meat, which
          is healthier and cheaper too!</p>

        <h3>Make</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add oil and
            then meat to heated oil.</li>
          <li>Use a wooden spoon to break meat up into bits. Brown
            for 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
          <li>Fold in your veggie puree and saute for another 3 to 4
            minutes.</li>
          <li>Add crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes. Boil and
            then simmer uncovered (be careful of spattering or just
            embrace it and clean up later) for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
          <li>While sauce is cooking, whisk together red wine vinegar,
            Dijon, and cooking oil. Salt and pepper vinaigrette to taste.</li>
          <li>When sauce is done simmering, taste and then season
            with more spices, salt, and or / pepper. If the sauce tastes
            too tart or acidic, temper it with something sweet like sugar.
          </li>
          <li> Divide pasta into bowls and plates and let everyone
            spoon as much sauce as they want over pasta. Serve
            with as much parmesan as you want and enjoy with side
            spinach salads.</li>
