        <p>Another way to do budget right is making once and eating
          twice - once for dinner and again for lunch. Soups are the
          perfect type of meals to scale up (and really you should always
          be scaling, because they freeze well and are cheaper and
          healthier than the canned variety). Chicken noodle is one of
          our favorites because it uses commonly available ingredients
          and will comfort everybody you serve it to.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rotisserie chicken, shredded - 1/2</li>
          <li>Garlic, minced - 4 cloves</li>
          <li>Onions (large), diced - 1</li>
          <li>Celery, diced - 3 ribs</li>
          <li>Carrots, diced - 5</li>
          <li>Italian seasoning - 1 tsp</li>
          <li>Bay leaves - 2</li>
          <li>Chicken stock - 8 cups</li>
          <li>Pasta, uncooked (like elbows, shells) - 2 cups</li>
          <li>Parmesan (opt) - for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prep</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rotisserie chicken | If not already done, take meat off the
            bone and shred. Use knife and fork or just hands. (Can be
            done up to 4 days ahead)</li>
          <li>Garlic / Onions / Celery / Carrots | Prep as directed. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Make</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Place rotisserie chicken, garlic, onions, celery, carrots,
            Italian seasoning, Bay leaves, and chicken stock in a
            slow cooker. Cook on low for ~6 hours. (If not cooking
            in slow cooker, heat up a Dutch oven over medium-high
            heat. Add some cooking oil and then garlic, onions, celery,
            and carrots to heated oil and saute for ~3 minutes. Add in Italian 
            seasoning, Bay leaf, stock, and chicken. Bring to a
            boil, and then simmer for ~15 minutes.)</li>
          <li>Cook pasta according to package instructions in a
            separate saucepan.</li>
          <li>When soup is done, fold cooked pasta into soup. Season
            soup to taste with salt and pepper. If you have salsa
            leftover from earlier in the week, you can also use it to
            season the soup. Enjoy warm with parmesan (if using).</li>
