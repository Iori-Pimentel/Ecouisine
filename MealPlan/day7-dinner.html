        <p>Pureed vegetable soups are another easy budget meal that
          satisfy and are also very healthy. Sweet potatoes have so much
          flavor on their own that you don’t need to do a whole lot to
          season it. Served with a side of roasted veggies, you have
          another easy vegetarian meal to end the week with.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients for Soup</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Onions (large), chopped - 1</li>
          <li>Sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed - 2 lbs</li>
          <li>Light coconut milk - 1 cup</li>
          <li>Curry powder - 1 Tbsp</li>
          <li>Ground ginger (opt) - 1/2 Tbsp</li>
          <li>Vegetable broth or water - 3 to 5 cups</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients for Roasted Cauliflower</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Frozen cauliflower - 1 lb</li>
          <li>Cooking oil - 1 Tbsp</li>
          <li>Cumin - 1 tsp</li>
          <li>Curry powder - 1 tsp</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prep</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Onions / Sweet potatoes | Prep as directed. (Can be done
            up to 3 days ahead)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Make</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat oven to 425F degrees.</li>
          <li>Toss cauliflower with oil, cumin, and curry powder right
            onto a sheet pan. Spread out into an even layer and roast
            for 25 minutes, shaking once midway through.</li>
          <li>While cauliflower roasts, heat a Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Add coconut milk (you should have
            some leftover from the oatmeal you made earlier in
            the week).</li>
          <li>Once coconut milk starts to bubble, add onions with a
            sprinkle of salt. Saute until softened, ~3 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add sweet potatoes, curry powder and ground ginger (if
            using). Saute for another minute.</li>
          <li>Add enough broth or water to cover all the ingredients.
            Cover and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10 to 12 minutes,
            until sweet potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork.</li>
          <li>Puree in batches in a blender or use an
            immersion blender directly in the pot until smooth.</li>
          <li>Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Finish
            cauliflower fresh out of the oven with more salt and
            pepper. Enjoy cauliflower as a side dish or fold it right
            into your creamy soup.</li>
