        <p>This another easy, healthy homemade meal for everyone
          to enjoy together over a leisurely Sunday breakfast. While
          avocados can sometimes be on the pricey side, you don’t need
          a lot to add a creamy topping to crispy toast. We love that eggs
          are affordable and healthy, which is why they seem like the
          perfect protein accompaniment to round out this meal.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Garlic cloves, minced - 2</li>
          <li>Avocados, large - 2 (or 3 medium-sized ones)</li>
          <li>Lemons, juice of - 1/2</li>
          <li>Olive oil - 2 Tbsp</li>
          <li>Eggs - 6</li>
          <li>Milk - 2 Tbsp</li>
          <li>Butter - 2 Tbsp</li>
          <li>Whole wheat bread - 4 slices</li>
          <li>Tomatoes, chopped or sliced - 1</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Extras and Swaps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Add dairy | If you love cheese, add a slice of cheese on top
            of avocado and put under a broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, until
            melty and bubbly.</li>
          <li>Make it Latin | Swap out tortillas for the bread. Toast
            tortillas in the oven, just like you did with bread but for a
            shorter time. Layer with black beans mixed with cumin,
            eggs, and avocado mash. Feel free to add some sour cream
            too!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Make</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Mince garlic, and place into a medium-sized mixing bowl.
            Scoop avocado into bowl. Add lemon juice, olive oil, and
            a good sprinkle of salt and pepper. Mash with a fork until
            you get the consistency you want.</li>
          <li>Whisk eggs with milk and some salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add butter.
            Once butter is melted, add eggs and let sit for 30 seconds
            to 1 minute before stirring with spatula. Continue stirring
            until you get the consistency you want. Transfer to a bowl
            so they don’t continue to cook.</li>
          <li>Toast bread in a toaster or toast using the broiler in your
            oven. If using your oven, adjust top rack so it’s as close to
            the broiler as possible. Place bread onto a sheet pan and
            broil 1 to 2 minutes on each side, until you get the golden
            color you want.</li>
          <li>Spread avocado mash onto warm toast and enjoy with
            scrambled eggs on the side. Top avocado with chopped or
            sliced tomatoes.</li>
        </ol>
