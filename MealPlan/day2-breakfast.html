        <p>If you’ve never made oatmeal with steel cut oats, definitely
          give them a go with this recipe. We use coconut milk for extra
          creaminess and a little sweetness too (most cans contain 2
          cups but don’t worry, you’ll use the rest in this weekend’s
          curried sweet potato soup!). This fiber-filled base serves as a
          blank palette for a variety of toppings - sweet and savory. We’ve
          chosen frozen fruit one morning and fresh sliced bananas the
          next, but feel free to try it with whatever you love best! </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Water - 8 cups</li>
          <li>Coconut milk, light - 1 cup</li>
          <li>Steel cut oats - 2 cups</li>
          <li>Brown sugar - 2 tsp</li>
          <li>Salt - ½ tsp</li>
          <li>Frozen berries, your choice - 2 cups</li>
          <li>Bananas, sliced - 2</li>
          <li>Walnuts, crushed - ½ cup</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Extras or Swaps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Feel free to skip the coconut milk or swap in regular milk</li>
          <li>Fruit toppings | chopped apples, pomegranate seeds, dried
            fruit - like raisins or chopped apricots, prunes, coconut
            shavings, any fresh berry, chopped mango</li>
          <li>Other toppings | pecans, almonds, pistachios, sunflower
            seeds, yogurt, honey, maple syrup, cinnamon</li>
          <li>Other ideas | chia or flax seeds (cook them right with the
            oatmeal)</li>
          <li>For savory oatmeal, skip the coconut milk (or swap in
            regular milk) and brown sugar.</li>
          <li>For a protein-packed version, top with a fried egg and some
            chopped up turkey slices.</li>
          <li>Eat like a Chinese congee, and add some chopped up ham
            or edamame. Top with green onions and drizzle on some soy
            sauce and / or toasted sesame oil.</li>
          <li>Enjoy an Italian spin, and add some chopped up prosciutto
            and sun-dried tomatoes. Top with parmesan shavings, pine
            nuts, and a fried egg.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Make</h3>
<ol>
          <li>Bring water and coconut milk to a boil in a large
            saucepan or Dutch oven. (If you have a rice cooker,
            you can also just combine all ingredients but fruit in the
            rice cooker, and hit the porridge setting if you have one.
            Otherwise, just hit cook.)</li>
          <li>Stir in oats, brown sugar, and salt. Simmer for 45 to 55
            minutes, until oats are tender.</li>
          <li>Divide in half. Stir frozen berries into one half and
            sliced bananas into the other half. Store in two separate
            containers or if you plan on taking them to-go and have
            plenty of Tupperware, divide each half into 4 separate
            containers and sprinkle with walnuts.</li>
          <li>To reheat for breakfast, use your microwave re-heat
            setting or microwave on high for 1 to 1 ½ minutes, stirring
            once midway through.</li>
        </ol>
